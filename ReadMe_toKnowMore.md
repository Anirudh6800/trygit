# Gradient Descent Optimization with Equal Interval Search

This project implements a gradient descent optimization method using an **Equal Interval Search** to find the optimal step size. It also includes validation tests and a 3D visualization of the function and descent direction.

## Features
- **Function Definition**: \( f(x, y) = 2x^2 + 3y^2 + 4xy + 10 \)
- **Gradient Descent with Equal Interval Search**: Finds the optimal step size for descent.
- **Validation Tests**:
  - Checks if the descent direction aligns with the minimum point.
  - Verifies that the computed minimum satisfies the gradient condition.
- **3D Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to plot the function and descent path.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
pip install numpy matplotlib
python Version2graphIncluded.py

##Output
Optimal Step Size: 0.195
Minimum Point: (0.2, -0.3)
Minimum Value: 9.2
Test passed: Descent direction aligns with the minimum point.
Test passed: The minimum point is the actual minimum.
